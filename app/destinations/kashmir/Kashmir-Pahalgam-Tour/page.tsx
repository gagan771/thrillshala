                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  The Shankaracharya Temple is a Hindu temple in Jammu and Kashmir, India. It is perched atop Shankaracharya Hill and is known as the Takht-e-Sulaiman. The temple is said to have been built on the spot where Adi Shankaracharya experienced enlightenment. According to legend, Lord Shiva visited him while meditating on the hill, revealing the universe's secrets and the Vedas' knowledge. This inspired Shankaracharya to write his famous commentaries on the Upanishads, the Brahma Sutras, and the Bhagavad Gita.
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  The temple is built on the hill's summit, surrounded by a large lake. It comprises two parts: the inner sanctum, the 'Garbhagriha,' and the outer hall, the 'Mandapa.' The inner sanctum has a small shrine dedicated to Lord Shiva, and the outer hall has a large open courtyard with a raised platform where devotees can listen to discourses and religious lectures.
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  The temple is open on all four sides and surrounded by four walls. The walls are decorated with intricate carvings depicting various Hindu gods and goddesses. A small door in one of the walls provides access to the inner sanctum.
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  The temple has a rich collection of sculptures, artefacts, and inscriptions. The sculptures are mainly of Shiva, Parvati, and their son Ganesh. The inscriptions are mainly in Sanskrit and are believed to be from the 8th century CE.
