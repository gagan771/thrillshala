                  **Srinagar**, the summer capital of J&K, lies in the heart of the Kashmir Valley, positioned along the tranquil Jhelum River. Four districts and Ladakh UT surround the city. To the north lies Ladakh, Ganderbal to the east, Pulwama to the south, and Budgam to the northwest. Located 1,585 meters above sea level, Srinagar is renowned for its beautiful gardens, lakes, houseboats, traditional Kashmiri handicrafts, and dried fruits. The Jhelum River, known as Vyath in Kashmir, flows through the city, winding through the valley and eventually merging with Dal Lake. Srinagar is also famous for its nine historic bridges, connecting the city's two parts.

                  **Hokersar**, a wetland located 14 km (8.7 miles) north of Srinagar, is an essential site for migratory birds. During winter, thousands of birds migrate from Siberia and other regions to Hokersar, making it a key stopover for birds travelling between Siberia, Central Asia, and Kashmir. The wetland, covering an area of 13.75 kmÂ² (5.31 sq mi), includes both lake and marshy areas and is among the most accessible and well-known of Kashmirâ€™s wetlands, alongside others such as Hygam, Shalibug, and Mirgund. The wetlands are critical in supporting a large population of wintering, staging, and breeding birds.

                  In the early 1900s, Sir Marc Aurel Stein, a famed Central Asian explorer, often sought solace in Gulmarg, camping between his expeditions. During the British colonial period, it became a favoured summer getaway for officers and their families.

                <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2 text-gray-700">Shankaracharya Hill</h4>
                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  The Shankaracharya Temple, located in the Srinagar district on Takht-e-Suleiman Hill, is 1,100 feet above the city. A shrine dedicated to Lord Shiva is perched at the peak of this hill. It is recognised as the oldest religious establishment in the Kashmir Valley. Over the years, the temple has undergone numerous repairs. It was repaired after an earthquake damaged it during the reign of Lalitaditya and later under Zain-ul-Abideen. Additional restoration work was done during Sheikh Mohi-ud-Din's tenure as governor. Maharaja Gulab Singh, a Dogra ruler, is credited with constructing the stone steps that lead to the temple. In 1925, the temple was also electrified.

                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  Situated in Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir, Dal Lake plays a crucial role in tourism and business, earning the title "Jewel in the Crown of Kashmir." The lake spans 18 square kilometres and is part of a wetland covering 21.1 square kilometres. Its shoreline features Mughal-era gardens, parks, houseboats, and hotels, with scenic views from gardens like Shalimar and Nishat Bagh. In winter, the lake sometimes freezes. The lake is divided into four basins, including Lokut Dal and Bod Dal, each with an island. Floating gardens, known as "Raad," bloom with lotus flowers in summer, making it a significant attraction.

                <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2 text-gray-700">Indira Gandhi Tulip Garden</h4>
                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  The Indira Gandhi Memorial Tulip Garden, formerly known as the Model Floriculture Center, is the most extensive in Asia, located in Srinagar. Spanning approximately 30 hectares, the garden is situated at the foothills of the Zabarwan Range, offering stunning views of Dal Lake. Opened in 2007, its purpose was to promote floriculture and boost tourism in the Kashmir Valley. The garden is designed on sloping land, with seven terraced levels. In addition to tulips, the garden also features other flower species, such as hyacinths, daffodils, and ranunculus. The Tulip Festival is an annual event held to highlight the variety of flowers in the garden, contributing to the tourism efforts of the Jammu and Kashmir Government. This celebration takes place at the beginning of spring in the Kashmir Valley.

                <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2 text-gray-700">Nishat Garden: The Garden of Delight</h4>
                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  Nishat Bagh, a terraced Mughal garden, lies on the eastern bank of Dal Lake near Srinagar in Jammu and Kashmir, India. It is the second-largest Mughal garden in the Kashmir Valley, surpassed only by Shalimar Bagh, which also borders Dal Lake. The name "Nishat Bagh," derived from Urdu, translates to "Garden of Joy," "Garden of Gladness," or "Garden of Delight."
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  **Setting and Historical Context:** Nestled against the backdrop of the Zabarwan Mountains, Nishat Bagh offers breathtaking views of Dal Lake and the distant snow-capped Pir Panjal mountain range. It was constructed in 1633 by Asif Khan, the elder brother of Empress Nur Jehan. An intriguing historical anecdote surrounds the garden: Emperor Shah Jahan, upon witnessing its beauty, expressed his admiration multiple times, hoping Asif Khan would gift the garden to him. When no offer was made, Shah Jahan ordered the garden's water supply to be cut off, leaving it abandoned for a time. Later, a loyal servant restored the water flow, and Shah Jahan, instead of reacting angrily, appreciated the act and reinstated water rights for the garden. The Mughal Princess Zuhra Begum, daughter of Emperor Alamgir II and granddaughter of Jahandar Shah, was buried in Nishat Bagh, adding to the site's historical significance.

                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  **Layout and Design:** While inspired by the Persian Chahar Bagh concept, Nishat Baghâ€™s design was adapted to fit the natural terrain of the Kashmir Valley. Instead of the square layout typical of Persian gardens, it follows a rectangular plan measuring 548 meters in length and 338 meters in width, with an axial stream running through its centre. The garden features twelve terraces symbolising the zodiac signs. These terraces cascade upward from Dal Lake toward the hillside, with an artificial faÃ§ade marking the upper boundary. The layout includes public and private sections, with the private "Zenana" or harem garden on the highest terrace. The gardenâ€™s central water channel, lined with Chinar and cypress trees, flows from the hilltop to the lake, forming sparkling cascades, pools, and fountains at each level. Stone ramps guide water between terraces, while benches at crossings allow visitors to rest and enjoy the serene surroundings.

                <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2 text-gray-700">Pari Mahal</h4>
                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  Located to the west of Srinagar, close to Chashme Shahi and nestled on the slopes of the Zebanwan mountains, Pari Mahal was built around 1650 by Prince Dara Shukoh, the eldest son of Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan. The garden was constructed on the site of an ancient Buddhist monastery. It was envisioned as a Sufi school, following the request of Dara Shukohâ€™s revered spiritual mentor, Mullah Shah Badakhshi. It is believed that Pari Mahal also served as a place for astronomical research and astrological studies under the Mughal rulers. The garden was named after Dara Shukoh's wife, Nadira Begum, also known as Pari Begum, who was the daughter of Prince Parviz, the son of Emperor Jahangir.
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  The structure of Pari Mahal includes a domed ceiling with a series of gardens arranged across six terraces, supported by arched retaining walls. The terraces vary in size, and the garden spans 122 meters by 62.5 meters at its widest point. Access to the terraces is provided by steps located at their corners. A pavilion, or baradari, sits on the fourth terrace, while another connects the fifth and sixth terraces. The gardenâ€™s entrance is on the fourth terrace, where a series of buildings, believed to have housed a Hamman (bath), once stood.
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  Unlike most Mughal gardens in Kashmir, which typically feature water channels and cascading waterfalls (chadars) to supply water, Pari Mahal relies on a distinct water system. The garden's water tanks are provided through an underground piping system, with water sourced from a nearby spring.
                </p>

                <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-4 mb-2 text-gray-700">Shalimar Garden</h4>
                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  The origins of Shalimar Bagh date back to the 6th century, with the site believed to have been home to a villa built by King Pravarassena II during that time, when the garden was considered a sacred place. The small village in the area retained the name Shalimar, while the villa and garden faded into history. In the 16th century, the Muslim king Zain-ul-Abidin was credited with constructing a canal and embankment for Shalimar. The lower section of the garden, known as Farah Bakhsh, meaning "Joy-Imparting" garden, was created by Emperor Jahangir around 1620, with Prince Khurram (later Emperor Shah Jahan) overseeing its construction. Like Nishat Bagh, the layout of this garden followed the traditional chahar bagh design. After Shah Jahan ascended to the throne, he added the upper garden, Fayz Bakhsh or "Bounty-Bestowing" garden, around 1630, expanding the space and creating the zenana (women's quarters). Zafar Khan, the Mughal governor of Kashmir, led this project, which included the addition of the black marble pavilion in the zenana.
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  Shalimar Bagh today spans approximately 594 by 250 meters and features five main terraces, making up two and a half Chahar baghs. The garden was divided into two parts according to its function for royalty. The lower portion, including the first three terraces, was designated Diwan-i-Aam (the public audience hall). In comparison, the upper two terraces were reserved for the Emperor and his courtiers, known as Diwan-i-Khas. A thick masonry wall with gateways on either side of the water channel separated these areas. The upper section, the zenana, was a private area for the Empress and her ladies.
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  Architecturally, Shalimar Bagh is more elaborate than many other Mughal gardens in Kashmir. Almost every terrace edge features significant architectural elements such as pavilions, pools, and cascading water channels. The garden design integrates the built environment with the natural surroundings, creating a harmonious balance. The Mughals intentionally minimised the grandeur of the buildings to avoid overshadowing the landscape's natural beauty. Among the garden's key structures are the Pink Pavilion in the Diwan-i-Aam area and the Black Pavilion in the Diwan-i-Khas. While Mughal architecture is less prominent in Kashmir than in other parts of India, these pavilions offer rare examples of Mughal architecture in the region. The Pink Pavilion, located over the water channel of the second terrace, is a rectangular open pavilion built with traditional badshahi bricks, featuring papier-mÃ¢chÃ© ceilings and intricately carved columns and railings. The Black Pavilion, an open structure on the fourth terrace, was built with brick masonry and stone-facing, with recessed niches and Takashi (paintings) on the walls. The pavilion is known for its black appearance due to the polished stone used in its construction.
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                  Shalimar Bagh also features six watch towers positioned at the four corners and in the middle of the garden. While the original Mughal planting scheme has changed over the years, the garden remains lush with flowers, well-maintained grass, and some fruit trees. Its unique quality lies in its blend of landscape and architectural features, enhanced by the surrounding agricultural landscape, rice fields, and the historic canal linking it to Dal Lake. A stunning mountain backdrop further frames the garden.
